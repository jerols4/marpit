# Marpit Markdown {docsify-ignore-all}

Marpit Markdown syntax focuses on compatibility with commonly Markdown documents. It means the result of rendering keeps looking nice even if you open the Marpit Markdown in a general Markdown editor.

## How to write slides?

Marpit splits pages of the slide deck by horizontal ruler (e.g. `---`). It's very simple.

```markdown
# Slide 1

foo

---

# Slide 2

bar
```

?> An empty line may be required before the dash ruler by the spec of [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#example-28). You can use the underline ruler `___`, asterisk ruler `***`, and space-included ruler `- - -` when you do not want to add empty lines.

## Extended features

### [Directives](/directives)

Marpit Markdown has extended syntax called **"Directives"** to support writing awesome slides. It can control your slide-deck theme, page number, header, footer, style, and so on.

### [Image syntax](/image-syntax)

Marpit has extended Markdown image syntax `![](image.jpg)` to be helpful creating beautiful slides.

### [Fragmented list](/fragmented-list)

Since v0.9.0, Marpit will parse lists with specific markers as the **fragmented list** for appearing contents one by one.
